## Requirements

These items need to be installed in order to properly run Zartan:

- Python >= 3.7
- Okta Org. You can sign-up for a free "dev edition" [here](https://developer.okta.com/)
- [Terraform](https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/) = 0.12.x :warning: The latest version is 0.13.x but the existing HCL scripts associated with this repo only supports v0.12.x. More details on upgrading the HCL script [here](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html) and [here](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html#explicit-provider-source-locations).
- (Optional) git client [git client installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Python

- Please refer to your OS specific instructions on installing [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

  - e.g. Mac users can install using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

    ```bash
    brew install python
    ```

> ℹ️  Mac users: If you've never run a Python app locally before, your machine is in an unknown state when it comes to Python development. It is a known issue for Python dependencies to have moved, become unlinked or deleted during MacOS upgrades (e.g. an upgrade to Catalina). If you have issues during any of the install steps (below) or when running Zartan locally, try reinstalling Python:

```bash
brew reinstall python
```

### Terraform

> ℹ️ The HCL script locate in `/terraform` was authored against Terraform v0.12.x. More details on upgrading the HCL script [here](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13.html) and [here](https://www.terraform.io/upgrade-guides/0-13). In short, you may upgrade HCL script using the following command under v0.13.x, `"$ terraform 0.13upgrade"`, but the associated Zartan HCL scripts may not work under v0.13.x. Be warned! :smile:

We've provided terraform files for easy configuration of the Okta Org. Specific verticals' `.tf` files are located in their respective `/terraform/{vertical}` folder. If you'd rather configure your Org manually, refer to [these steps](#setup-okta-org-for-each-vertical-outside-of-terraform).

- [Install Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/terraform/getting-started/install#install-terraform) for your OS

- e.g. for Mac users, you can use homebrew:

```bash
brew install terraform
```

* Verify terraform is installed correctly by going to the command line/shell, and type the command `terraform version`.

```bash
# sample output
$ terraform version
Terraform v0.12.28
```

---

## Install

Open up a terminal/shell then:
1. Git [`clone`](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) this repo:

    ```bash
    # e.g. using https
    git clone https://github.com/udplabs/zartan.git
    ```

2. After cloning, `cd` into the `zartan` folder.

3. Use "virtual env" aka [`venv`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) to setup a contained environment to run the zartan app without impacting your system's Python environment.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

    Or,  just `python -m venv venv` if you only have python 3.x installed on your system.

    *(Python allows multiple versions to be installed; For Mac users, most likely you'll have both python 2.7 on your local instance along with python 3.x.)*

4. Activate the `venv` environment: <a name="venv-activate"></a>.
    * On Mac/Linux

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

    * On Windows:

    ```bash
    .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```

    > ℹ️  NOTE: You'll notice that venv has "activated" when there is a `(venv)` in your command prompt:
    > * Mac/Linux:
    > ```bash
    > #zsh
    > user@macbook zartan % source venv/bin/activate
    > (venv) user@macbook zartan %
    > ```
    >
    > * Windows:
    > ```
    > C:\temp123> .\venv\Scripts\activate.bat
    > (venv) C:\temp123>
    > ```
    > __As best practice, ALWAYS run inside venv. For more information on why you'd want to do this, read up on `venv` [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)__.

5. Install dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    NOTE: You may need to run as `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` if you have python 2.7 on your local instance along with python 3.x

### Option 1/2 - Configure, initialize and apply Terraform for the vertical you want to use

> ℹ️  Zartan is a collection of demos for different verticals. In addition to the `.tf` files in the `/terraform/{vertical}` folders, there are also vertical specific READMEs in `/docs/{vertical}`. __For readability, this documentation will perform all following steps as if we're in the `travelagency` vertical.__ If you're installing/setting up a different vertical, simply reference the folder and/or file for that vertical.

1. `cd` into `/terraform/travelagency`.

2. Copy `travelagency.tfvars.sample` into `travelagency.tfvars`.

3. Edit in the variables of the `travelagency.tfvars` file.

    ```bash
    org_name        = "<okta_subdomain, e.g. atko>"
    api_token       = "<okta_api_token>"
    base_url        = "<the okta domain  e.g. oktapreview.com, okta.com, or okta-emea.com>"
    ```

4. Rename the file `localhost.tf.none` to `localhost.tf`.

    > This `.tf` file is for adding a CORS trusted origin `http://localhost:8666` to the Okta Org. If you already have this trusted origin in your org, skip this step.

5. Initialize terraform.

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

6. Execute the "plan".

    ```bash
    terraform plan -var-file travelagency.tfvars
    ```

7. "Apply" the plan.

    ```bash
    terraform apply -var-file travelagency.tfvars
    ```

    Type `'yes'` at the prompt. Once it is completed you should see a message similar to `Apply complete! Resources: 6 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.`

8. Verify by checking in your Okta Org.

    > NOTE: The terraform script for `travelagency` generates: 1. an OIDC Client, 2. an Auth Server, and 3. adds CORS for http://localhost:8666.

9.  Return to the root folder.

    > Your Org should be setup now so get out of `/terraform/travelagency` (go back to `/zartan` or "project root") to complete the rest of the steps.

### Option 2/2 - Declare local environment variables in a .env file for the vertical you want to use

> NOTE: ℹ️ Optional, if you prefer to use your own SparkPost account the following [documentation](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-sparkpost/) should help.

Set up the `.env` file:

- Copy the [`.env.sample`](../.env.sample) (in the root directory) file into `.env` (this should also be in the root directory). Look for and edit these values in the file:

    | Variable               | Value |
    | ---------------------- | ----- |
    | OKTA_CLIENT_ID         | Terraform created an OIDC client named `local travelagency Demo (Generated by UDP)`. Provide its `client_id` |
    | OKTA_CLIENT_SECRET     | Terraform created an OIDC client named `local travelagency Demo (Generated by UDP)`. Provide its `client_secret` |
    | OKTA_ISSUER            | Terraform created an Auth Server named `local travelagency`. Provide its `issuer_uri` |
    | OKTA_ORG_URL           | Your org url. e.g. `https://dev-13485.oktapreview.com` |
    | OKTA_OIDC_REDIRECT_URI | Use `http://localhost:8666/authorization-code/callback` as this was set by Terraform.
    | OKTA_API_TOKEN         | Provide an okta SSWS key |
    | AWS_API_KEY            | ℹ️ Mandatory. Get the value from this [Box folder](https://okta.box.com/s/56cnuhratuzjnhxo1odt11tmesjqv4o3) (Only accessible to Okta employees) |
    | SPARKPOST_API_KEY      | ℹ️ Mandatory. Get the value from this [Box folder](https://okta.box.com/s/56cnuhratuzjnhxo1odt11tmesjqv4o3) (Only accessible to Okta employees) |
    | SPARKPOST_FROM_DOMAIN  | ℹ️ Optional. You can use your own API KEY but SparkPost requires a registered domain. This Environment Variables overrides the default `"recintodev.com"`. |

- Select which third party email services: `AWS Email` or `SparkPost` to use or bring your own SparkPost API KEY. [More details.](https://www.sparkpost.com/docs/getting-started/getting-started-sparkpost/)

    | Variable               | Value |
    | ---------------------- | ----- |
    | AWS_API_KEY            | ℹ️ Mandatory. Get the value from this [Box folder](https://okta.box.com/s/56cnuhratuzjnhxo1odt11tmesjqv4o3) (Only accessible to Okta employees). |

### Run The App

- Remember to "activate" `venv`. See [__Install__ section](#venv-activate).
- Then, run python

```bash
python app.py
```

> NOTE: You may need to run as `python3 app.py` if you have python 2.7 on your local instance along with python 3.x

- Open up a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8666`
